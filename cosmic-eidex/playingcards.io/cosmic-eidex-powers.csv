label,priority,character,description
Dealer,1,Dealer,"Before each trick, Dealer (the character, not the player dealing the cards) may exchange his hand with another player if the other player agrees. Dealer cannot force an exchange."
Jiu-Jitsu,2,Jiu-Jitsu,"Once per game, Jiu-Jitsu may swap two cards in a trick that are next to each in the rank order. Example: Jiu-Jitsu stops the game and decides that a nine beats a ten in that trick. Or the nine of trump beats the jack of trump. Or the ten of trump beats the queen of trump (as the jack of trump is ranked higher, the queen and ten are next to each other in the rank order)."
Ultimo,3,Ultimo,"If he wants to, Ultimo may take the last trick. If the queen of stars (Justice) is using her power in that game, Ultimo only gets his own card and the 5 points for the last trick."
Trumphator,4,Trumphator,"After the cards have been dealt, Trumphator may reject the trump suit determined by the face-up card and make the card dealt second-to-last determine the trump suit. Trumphator may not look at the second card before deciding to use his power."
Computer,5,Computer,May add or subtract 5 points to his score at the end of the game.
Thief,6,Thief,"After the cards have been dealt, Thief may steal the trump card (the face-up card dealt last). In return, he gives the dealer one card from his hand. If the Thief is the dealer for this game, he may force the player holding the six of trump in his hand to exchange it with the face-up trump card."
Peeping Tom,7,Peeping Tom,"May ask another player once per game to show him 5 cards from his hand. The named player decides which 5 cards to show. If he has 5 or less cards at that time, he has to show all of them."
Quizmaster,8,Quizmaster,"After each trick, the Quizmaster may ask an opponent a question about his cards, which he has to answer truthfully with yes or no. May also disclose any information about his own hand that he wants to."
Feminist,9,Feminist,"May refuse to take a trick that contains both a queen and a king or jack. If Feminist uses her power, the second highest card in that trick wins the trick. She is not obligated to refuse such a trick, she can take it if she wants to."
Shyness,10,Shyness,"May refuse to lead a trick. Instead of leading herself, she draws a card to be lead from another player's hand (without looking at the hand or revealing the card). The other player may refuse to lead that card, in which case she draws another card, which then has to be played."
Tea Party,11,Tea Party,"After every player has put down a card, Tea Party gets one card each from both of the other players. She looks at the cards and give both players a card back (it can be the same they gave her)."
Justice,12,Justice,"May declare justice once per game: For the next two tricks, the players get their cards back for scoring purposes (they do not go into the players' hands again). The highest card still leads the next trick. If seven of stars (Jackpot) is using his power in this game, tricks containing only lizard and raven cards do not add to the jackpot during justice. Ten of hearts (Social Security) may only award the right to lead, not the cards during justice."
Skater,13,Skater,"May call Skat at any time during the game, which immediately changes the rules in the following way: Trump cards can only be played if the player has no cards belonging to the suit being led in his hand, and the tens rank between ace and king (they now beat kings, queens, and non-trump jacks). Skat is in effect for the remainder of that game and may not be reversed."
Black Peter,14,Black Peter,"May call Black Peter before the players put down their one card: The player winning the trick containing the jack of raven loses and the other players get a victory point each. If raven is the trump suit or two or more players have six victory points, Black Peter cannot be called. The jack of raven must not be put down, if Black Peter has been called. However, Match overrules Black Peter: if a player gets all the tricks, he gets 2 victory points as usual."
Fond of Suits,15,Fond of Suits,"May ask for a certain suit to be led twice during the game. If the player who is leading doesn't have that suit, he doesn't need to comply."
Hot Guy,16,Hot Guy,"May declare a double trick once per game: Every player plays a second card (which can legally be played at that time) on top of that trick. The six cards count as one trick, the highest card takes it."
Differentiator,17,Differentiator,"Before the first trick, Differentiator may guess the number of points he is going to make in that game. If he takes at least one trick and scores his number, he gets the two victory points, otherwise the game counts as normal."
Cop,18,Cop,"If Cop has the lead, he can ask for a certain card once per game. If a player has that card in his hand, he must play it in this trick. If the card has been played already or cannot legally be played in that trick or has been put down, nothing happens. If the jack of raven (Black Peter) is using his power, Cop cannot ask for the jack of raven."
Social Security,19,Social Security,"May award any trick of 3 or less points to a person in need. However, the Social Security decides herself who is in need, which can be herself. Because of the 5 extra points, the last trick cannot be given away. If seven of stars (Jackpot) is using his power in this game, the Social Security only awards the right to lead; the trick goes into the jackpot. If the seven of stars or hearts is in a trick with 3 or less points, Social Security can give away the trick plus the jackpot."
Wise Guy,20,Wise Guy,"Wise Guy can announce certain combinations of cards in her hand before the first trick in order to receive bonus points for them. At the end of the game, Wise Guy can either add or subtract the bonus points from her score. These are the points for combinations she may use: 40 points, 4 jacks; 30 points, 4 nines; 20 points, 5 cards of one suit in a row, 4 aces, 4 kings, 4 queens, or 4 tens; 10 points, 4 cards of one suit in a row; 4 points, 3 cards of one suit in a row or king and queen of the trump suit.

Laser,21,Laser,"Draws the card the other players have to put down from their hands (at random, without looking at their hands). If another player leads the first trick, Laser draws the card he has to lead as well."
Speed Limit,22,Speed Limit,"Before the cards are put down, Speed Limit may adjust the limit, which should not be reached (usually 100 points) to an arbitrary number between 80 and 120 points."
Consumer Protection,23,Consumer Protection,May reject a card once per game. The player whose card has been rejected must play a different card in that trick. He can still play the rejected card in a later trick.
Seer,24,Seer,"After the other two players have put their cards down, Seer may look at them. He also waits until the first card has been led before he puts down his card. Nine of lizard (Laser) does not draw a card from Seer, but does also not reveal his face down card to him."
Upgrade,25,Upgrade,"After the cards have been put down, Upgrade may declare an arbitrary card to be the highest card in that suit. However, he can only upgrade cards that are not in his possession. Example: Upgrade upgrades the eight of hearts. For the duration of this game, the rank order in hearts is 8-A-K-Q-J-10-9-7-6 or 8-J-9-A-K-Q-10-7-6, if hearts is trump. The point values are not affected."
Zombie,26,Zombie,"If Zombie uses his power, every player must pick up a card from the last trick that they have previously won. If a player has not yet won a trick, he has to pick up his face down card. Zombie can use his power once per game and only, if at least two players have won tricks (Cards won back due to the power of the queen of stars (Justice) count as a trick)."
Excuse,27,Excuse,May not follow suit once per game and play a non-trump card with value 3 or less instead.
Cheater,28,Cheater,"As long as he has 4 or more cards still in his hand, Cheater may exchange a card from his hand with the card he put down in the beginning."
Rejector,29,Rejector,May reject a trick once per game: Every player takes his card back. Rejector may lead for the replay of that trick if he wants to.
Grave Robber,30,Grave Robber,"After the player have put their one card down, Grave Robber may put down a second card and pick up the face down card of one other player (without looking at it before). In return, the other player receives the second card Grave Robber put down. He may look at it, but not pick it up."
Guggidollars,31,Guggidollars,"If Guggidollars uses his power (before the first trick but after the cards have been put down), the game changes: The king of stars is worth 4 points, each heart 1 worth point each, all others worth nothing, for a total of 13 points. If a player gets all 13 points but not all the tricks (match), he loses (and the other two players get a victory point each). Otherwise, the players with the highest and lowest score get a victory point each, as usual. If two players are tied, the third gets two victory points, as before. The king of stars must not be put down. The powers of the jack of raven (Black Peter), king of lizards (Computer), and nine of raven (Speed Limit) are cancelled. However, the ten of lizards (Differentiator) still gets the victory points if his ""regular"" score matches his prediction."
Jackpot,32,Jackpot,"Before the players put their card down, Jackpot may declare ""Jackpot with seven of hearts"" or ""Jackpot with seven of stars"": He starts a jackpot with his face down card. All tricks consisting entirely of lizard or raven cards are not won by the player with the highest card; they add to the jackpot. The player who wins the trick containing the jackpot card (seven of hearts or seven of stars) gets the whole jackpot. The player winning the jackpot may not look at the face down card. Hint: The jackpot can be kept small if the jackpot card is played early in the game."
Compass,33,Compass,May determine the direction of play before the first trick is played. Compass can change the direction twice per game.
Black Friday,34,Black Friday,"May call Black Friday after the card has been put down: He chooses a suit (other than raven) whose cards lose their values (but not their rank order). The values are added to the respective raven card. Example: Black Friday invalidates the stars with stars being trump. Then the jack of raven is worth 22 points (2+20 from the jack of trump), nine of raven counts 14 points, ace of raven (11+11), etc. All stars cards count nothing. The game however doesn't change; the jack of stars is still the highest trump."
Wishbone,35,Wishbone,"May ask for a specific card before the players put their card down. However, the donor in return draws a random card out of Wishbone's hand."
Sphinx,36,Sphinx,"May play a card face down up to two times per game. Sphinx must tell who won that trick. The card is not revealed until the end. If Sphinx leads a card face down, she must tell its suit. The Sphinx may not lie about the suit or the winner of the trick."
